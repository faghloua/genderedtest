GenderedNews measures gender inequality in mentions and quotes by men and women within the articles published by main French newspapers. These measures highlight the very large share of content devoted to men in the media, both in terms of mentionning (having news stories that talk about men) and quoting (having news stories in which men do the talking). They also allow us to visualize the differences between newspapers and the evolution of these practices over time.
